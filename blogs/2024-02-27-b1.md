Attention, AI enthusiasts! 

Introducing TechAurora LLC, pioneering the future of AI-driven streaming, where we're all about making cool stuff happen. While we're still in the early stages of development, we're excited to share our vision with you. We may be a small LLC, but we've got big dreams and a surprisingly high employee count of... well, just me. We might be a one-person show, but we dream big and work even harder! Without a salary! Dedication!

Our first mission is to develop an AI-driven streamer with a fully customizable workflow that runs right on your local machine. Currently, we're in the process of system design and we're thrilled to announce that coding will commence next week. We're meticulously planning every detail to ensure a top-notch product.

No need to hassle with registering another website (although you'll still have to handle the live channel and other necessary services yourself, leading to a billion API keys... because we're not selling APIs or hosting our own server. we're on a tight budget, you know).

Once you've set up those API keys (and our beta version has been released, of course), brace yourself for some truly mind-blowing possibilities. Picture this: an AI streamer that chats with you and your audience, focuses solely on you, or even ignores you completely and hones in on your in-game team chat when they're talking. Yes, it's called AI streamer, but you don't have to be a streamer to use our product, you don't have to use it on streaming either. Have fun with your friends? Find some way to make AI assist your study/work easier? It's versatile enough to fit into any scenario you can think of.

In our first beta release, you can expect the basics: chat pulling from Twitch or other platforms, text completion through OpenAI APIs or locally, and even text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities. And that's just the beginning. Future updates might bring you goodies like Speech-To-Text (STT) and a whole bunch of logic components to level up your streaming game.

Our ultimate goal is to make the modules fully moddable, where everyone may create new helpful mods other users can install to our product. We wish to create a vibrant workshop community around our product. We want to see people coming together, sharing ideas, and pushing the boundaries of what our AI streamer is capable of. It's all about collaboration and unleashing the creativity within.

Oh, and did I mention we're open-sourced? Yep, we believe in the power of sharing. So feel free to contribute, support us if you can (I'm a broke entrepreneur, after all), and let's keep the spirit of open-source alive. Together, we'll keep things pure and full of possibilities.

Stay tuned, folks. The future of streaming just got a whole lot more exciting with TechAurora LLC!
