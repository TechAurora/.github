Hello for whomever focusing on our development process!

You might be wondering why there is no code on GitHub right now, as we announced we would be posting this week, and why you can't see any projects right now. Please sit still; we did not give the project up. Our hardworking one and only programmer a.k.a. I myself has already started developing the software from scratch, but he is programming as he learns and early codes can looks crappy. Also after careful investigation, we have realized that it would be impossible to design the architecture without knowing how activiti works. Thus we decide to learn the basics and design the system first, then upload the schema diagram along with the code if we are ever going to draw one. Once we build the project's fundamental structure, we will upload it to GitHub. 

It makes quite some sense, right? Building a car starting with an engine is way more convincing than building a car starting with sheetmetals. Yes, we are currently spending time figuring out how to build the basic virtual engine before coding our virtual car, although many others can make one in seconds. We are not ashamed to admit we are learning, as we are trying hard to learn new knowledge, to use them in our product, and we're not afraid of new things. 

Wish everyone good luck, we will be back soon.
